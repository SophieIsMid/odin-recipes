        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This is one of my biggest comfort foods. Any time of the year, any time of the day, and
            I will be down for a bowl of this. It is rich and hearty and fills you up! It goes great
            served with cornbread, my favorite way being to crumble it over the stew in your bowl.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 pound of smoked sausage, sliced</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons bacon grease (butter is ok as a substitute)</li>
                <li>1 head of cabbage, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>5 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
                <li>6 medium potatos, cubed</li>
                <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>salt, pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Saute sausage in vegetable oil in a large pot, until browned.</li>
                <li>Add onions and carrots and cook until onions start to become translucent.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and celery and stir consistently for a minute.</li>
                <li>Add chicken broth and potatos and let stew on medium-low for 15-20 minutes, or
                    until the potatos are tender.</li>
                <li>Add cabbage and salt/pepper to taste. Cook cabbage and until desired firmness.
                    (I prefer the cabbage to retain a bit of crunch, so I dont exceed 5 minutes here)</li>
                <li>Serve hot as-is or with hot sauce and cornbread!</li>
            </ol>
