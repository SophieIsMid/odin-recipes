        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Spam seems to get a lot of hate around where I live. Im not really sure why, because
                it goes with everything! This is fried rice that incorporates spam as its main meat.
                I like to make a large amount of this at a time because it still tastes great as
                leftovers, heated or cold!</p>
