        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This is one of my favorite desserts! It is very simple and quick to make.
                and the best part is that it requires no baking!.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups cold milk</li>
                <li>1 (5oz.) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
                <li>1 (14oz.) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 (12oz.) container frozen whipped topping, thawed (make sure to use 
                    <strong>frozen</strong> whipped topping, canned whipped cream does not have the same 
                    consistency!)</li>
                <li>1 (16oz.) package vanilla wafers</li>
                <li>1 large bunch of bananas, sliced</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather your ingredients; make sure your whipped topping is thawing, your milk is cold and your bananas are sliced.</li>
                <li>Place milk and pudding mix into a large bowl, and whisk until mix is fully dissolved.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the condensed milk until smooth.</li>
                <li>Stir in the vanilla, and fold the whipped topping into the mixture.</li>
                <li>Layer in your dish wafers, banana slices, and pudding mixture. Create multiple layers if you have a taller dish.</li>
                <Li>Chill, and top with crushed wafers when ready to serve.</Li>
            </ol>
