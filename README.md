### Notes before project
I hope to gain a solid handle on the basic setup
and framework of websites with this project.This 
includes index pages and creating links to other
pages, as well as adding text and images to pages

### Notes after project
I forgot to add this once I had completed the
project. Having a detailed README file and constant
commits are something that I still need further
practice to get into the habit of completing both of
those as I am working.

However, I am very pleased with the results of my project.
HTML has moved from being a foreign language in my eyes,
to now being able to inspect web pages and being able to
(mostly) decipher and understand the language and structure
even on a website or file that I did not create myself, and
that is a great feeling. I feel like this project really
helped me go from just reading lessons and taking notes to
actually knowing how it all functions and goes together, and
to be able to create the framework for any webpage I might 
need to make in the future.
